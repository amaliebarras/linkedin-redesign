# U.S. Web Design Standards Design Assets

This repository hosts editable, open source design files of the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards) for government designers or anyone wishing to make use of the UI components or visual style guide in this site.

For the alpha release, the following file types are available for your use:
- .AI (Adobe Illustrator) 
- .EPS 
- Sketch 
- Omnigraffle
- Font files (Fontawesome, Merriweather, Source Sans Pro)
- Color Swatches

We encourage and solicit your input. Please leave any feedback in the project's primary repo here: https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards

## About the Sketch files

Some single-function components, such as buttons, have been turned into symbols for easy access from the
symbol menu. Before you alter anything but text, detach the instance of the symbol so that you don’t change
every instance. More complex components, such as footers, have been left as groups.

Wherever appropriate, we have created type styles and layer styles to make these components more easily
adapted.

Style and symbol names are a compromise between U.S. Web Design Standards CSS naming conventions (to
transition Sketch files more easily into development) and names that make sense for when thinking about
screen design.
