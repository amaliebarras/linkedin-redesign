####Threats / Competetive Analysis: 
Smaller, more niche apps, AKA “death by 1,000 pin pricks.” 

* Glassdoor
	* Lets you search specifically by salary
* Craigslist
	* Has map search feature
* Facebook Groups
	* Austin Digital Jobs & The like can be an awesome community and forum to get advice on the local job market, not just generic job seeking advice
* Doximity
	* “In medicine, you want to get referrals. You want to be the guy in town who does the best ankle replacement surgery, but at the same time to market yourself is a little gauche,” says Tangney. “We make it easy for them to have a robust CV without having to type it all in.” 
* Spiceworks
	* Spiceworks also offers users an audio-visual resume option to help them better explain their work experience to people without IT expertise. That’s something they can’t get on LinkedIn.
* Viadeo
	* A competor to linkedin outside of the US

##User Testing

### 1 -

####Hypothesis -
The profiles take way too long to complete

####Test -
Make a profile

* User felt offended at the tagline "be great at what you do," felt like she is already great at nurse anesthaesia and didn't feel like she needed a profile to tell her that 
* Felt impatient & did not care read all the options when prompted with "what are you interested in?"
* Violated by linkedin asking for access to yahoo contacts right away
* Annoyed when they immediately asked her to invite people in, felt like it was misleading
* Annoyed by second prompt of "what are you interested in?", Expected to receive spam emails
* Wouldn't have downloaded the app, didn't want an extra thing on her phone

---

### 2 - 

####Hypothesis - 
Users are afraid to freely browse LinkedIn because it tells the person you were looking at their profile

####Test - 
Make your profile not show up under "who viewed you?"

* Felt violated that LinkedIN notified me when she viewed my profile. "What? That's kind of creepy"
* Impatient with how many buttons she had to scroll over to find account settings. 
* Confused as to where the setting was within account settings, when she finally founded felt the wording was not right. 
* Unsure when she changed it, she did not see the update notification, so she didn't felt secure that she completed her task. 

---
### 3 -

####Hypothesis -
The search filters are too subtle

####Test -
Search for a job at a small company in the medical field

* Felt lost when she accidentally went to "post job" on linkedin, saw the fields prompting her to desctibe job
* "I feel like an idiot" :( 
* Unsure whether to find the company size filter, ended up scanning through the light grey text on the posting (hard to see)
* Found the location filter difficult to use, but did find it. And then found company size when she looked closer (location was expanded out)
* Felt overwhelmed by the number of options.
